# Performance Optimization Overview

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines systematic performance improvements to achieve real-time video processing (30+ FPS) with smooth graph updates. The focus is on runtime speed optimization for Nuitka compilation, prioritizing performance over security concerns.

## Current Performance Analysis

### Identified Bottlenecks

**Critical Performance Issues:**
1. **Frame Processing Pipeline** - QImage conversions and memory allocations in every frame
2. **Mathematical Calculations** - Expensive scipy curve_fit and full linear regression recalculation
3. **Graph Updates** - Full matplotlib redraw on every frame update
4. **Memory Management** - Continuous allocation/deallocation of numpy arrays and objects
5. **Threading Overhead** - Signal/slot communication and thread synchronization

**Target Performance Goals:**
- 30+ FPS video processing (33ms max per frame)
- <16ms frame processing time
- 10-15Hz graph updates
- <5ms mathematical calculations per frame
- Smooth real-time visualization without stuttering
