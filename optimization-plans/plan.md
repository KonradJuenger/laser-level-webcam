# Performance Optimization Plan - Overview

## Executive Summary

This overview document summarizes the comprehensive 4-phase performance optimization plan for the Laser Level Webcam Tool. The complete plan has been sharded into specialized documents for detailed implementation.

## Plan Structure

The optimization plan is divided into 4 phases over 4 weeks, with each phase documented in detail:

### ðŸ“‹ [Complete Plan Documents](optimization-plans/)

- **[Phase 1: Critical Performance Optimizations](optimization-plans/phase1-critical-performance.md)** - Week 1
- **[Phase 2: Threading and UI Optimization](optimization-plans/phase2-threading-ui.md)** - Week 2  
- **[Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations](optimization-plans/phase3-advanced.md)** - Week 3
- **[Phase 4: Performance Monitoring and Tuning](optimization-plans/phase4-monitoring.md)** - Week 4
- **[Implementation Timeline](optimization-plans/implementation-timeline.md)** - Detailed daily schedule
- **[Overview](optimization-plans/overview.md)** - Executive summary and structure

## Quick Reference

### Target Performance Goals:
- **30+ FPS** video processing (from current 5-10 FPS)
- **<16ms** frame processing time (from current 50-100ms)
- **10-15Hz** smooth graph updates
- **<60%** CPU usage (from current 80-90%)
- **Nuitka compilation** ready with 20%+ performance boost

### Phase Overview:

**Week 1: Critical Bottlenecks** ðŸš€
- Frame processing pipeline optimization
- Mathematical algorithm replacement (scipy â†’ fast algorithms)
- Memory management and object pooling

### Expected Overall Improvements:
- **6x faster** frame processing
- **10x faster** mathematical calculations  
- **5x faster** graph updates
- **50%+ reduction** in CPU usage
- **Stable memory** usage without leaks

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [Overview](optimization-plans/overview.md)** for detailed performance analysis
2. **Follow the [Implementation Timeline](optimization-plans/implementation-timeline.md)** for day-by-day execution
3. **Implement each phase** using the detailed phase documents
4. **Monitor progress** against the success metrics in each phase

This modular approach allows for:
- **Independent implementation** of each optimization category
- **Incremental testing** and validation
- **Risk mitigation** with fallback options
- **Clear progress tracking** against measurable goals

The plan prioritizes the highest impact optimizations first, ensuring rapid improvement in real-time performance while maintaining code stability and functionality.
